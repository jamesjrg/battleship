todo:
- when game is won or lost show popup box
- make enemy take their turns with some basic rules on where they shoot

Enemy AI:
- has to follow basic rules of not shooting stuff it has already shot at 
- don't bother with anything more advanced, don't want to spend too much time doing this

Towards end of time:
- include note re: bonus points: as it was taking me quite a lot of time anyway I have not bothered with any unit tests, the AI is just random (other than avoiding places it has already tried before), and there are no game modes or manual placing of ships. FWIW the source is in a git repository.
- note extra rule added: you can tell if a ship has been sunk or is merely damaged
- search for "xxx"

Sites code is vaguely based on:
"WPF Apps With The Model-View-ViewModel Design Pattern" http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd419663.aspx
"John Conway's Game of Life in XAML/WPF using embedded Python" http://www.thinkbottomup.com.au/site/blog/Game_of_Life_in_XAML_WPF_using_embedded_Python

Not going to bother with:
- AI that realised things like e.g. note a sunk Battleship must be surrounded by water, a ship square without a non-ship square showing the end needs some shots (until it has been sunk), or other stuff
- unit tests
- Optionally make computer attack pattern random (options items in menu, or just a tick box in menu)
- less space between cells
- A game mode where each player gets 3 attacks before their opponent has to announce which ones hit.
- human choosing ship placement
- is EventSetter for left button down in the right place?
- could use itemscontrol rather than listbox?
- maybe rather than using PreviewMouseLeftButtonDown to collect clicks on grid, should use mousrleft down and HandledEventsToo (web says do in code behind, but looks like xaml also has the property), or otherwise remove the standard handler
- maybe rather than deciding what happens on button click using binding, have subclasses of View/SeaGrid
- things from bonus points
- about box, help
- when someone sinks a ship, show a popup box
- ship placement needs a few more rules (at least one square of freedom around a ship)
